# QA Engineer Bootcamp

<img src="images/tripleten-logo3.jpeg">

## Course description
TripleTen's QA Bootcamp was an intensive three-month program focused on training professionals in the essential practices of Quality Assurance (QA). The course was designed to provide a thorough understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and apply it to practical and challenging scenarios.

**The content was separated into five sprints with deliverable projects at the end of each one. You can check the scope of the course by sprints in the course-scope document and the duration of each one in the course-timeline document.**

## Targets
- Learn and apply fundamental QA concepts.
- Develop practical skills through projects that simulate real market situations.
- Deepen knowledge of test design, bug reporting and front-end and back-end testing.
- Use databases/SQL and work with REST/JSON software architectures.
- Complete five projects applying the best QA practices to consolidate learning.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Postman: For performing manual API tests.
- DevTools: For inspecting and testing page elements.
- JIRA: For project management and bug reports.
- Visual Studio Code: As a development environment for designing BDD scenarios.
- PostgreSQL: For database testing and queries.
- Swagger/ApiDoc: For documentation and analysis of APIs.
- Figma and Draw.io: For designing test flows and diagrams.

## Methodology
#### Course structure
- The Bootcamp was divided into theoretical and practical sessions, with a focus on project-based learning. Each module covered a specific QA stage, culminating in a practical project that replicated market demands.

#### Projects
- Project 1: Regression testing of web interfaces and bug reports.
- Project 2: Analyzing and decomposing requirements, identifying equivalence classes and limit values and writing test cases.
- Project 3: Selection of configuration for cross-browser testing, Compilation of checklists to address testing, Conducting independent tests and bug reporting.
- Project 4: Testing RESTful APIs with Postman.
- Project 5: Complete test simulation in a production environment, combining front-end, back-end and database.

**Note:** The detailed repertoire of projects can be viewed in the repositories project-urban.grocers, project-urban.routes and project-urban.scooter.

### Learnings and Skills Acquired
- Test design: Creation of effective and detailed test scenarios.
- API testing: Use of Postman for endpoint validation.
- Bug reports: Accurate and complete documentation of software faults.
- Database Analysis: SQL queries to validate and investigate data.
- Working with REST/JSON Architectures: Understanding and testing systems based on these technologies.
- Test documentation: Use of Swagger and ApiDoc to keep documentation organized.
- QA Tools: Practical use of essential tools such as JIRA and DevTools.

### Outcomes
At the end of the course, I was able to apply QA practices autonomously in projects of realistic complexity, acquiring the confidence to work in professional environments. I completed all the projects, which were assessed according to industry standards, ensuring the applicability of the knowledge acquired.

### Future improvements
The QA area is constantly evolving, and some improvements I plan to implement in future studies include:

- Delving deeper into automated testing with Cypress and Selenium.
- Studying programming languages, such as JavaScript, to create more complex automation scripts.
- Participation in open source projects to broaden practical experience.
- Writing in BDD with Gherkin syntax for better test organization.

### How to execute projects
- Clone the repository: git clone <url-do-repositorio>
- Navigate to the project directory: cd project-name
- Open the project in an IDE: Use Visual Studio Code or another of your choice.
- Install the dependencies (if applicable).
- Run the tests and scripts according to the project documentation.
